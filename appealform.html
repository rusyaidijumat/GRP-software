				ACADEMIC APPEAL FORM</p>
			<p>Appeals may only  be made against a final decision of an academic body and must be submitted  within one calendar month of notification of that decision. The appeals process  is open to all students of the University of Nottingham, except for those who  have had their registration suspended by the University, other than at their  own request under the Voluntary Suspension of Registration procedure.  </p>
			<p>Before submitting  an appeal please read carefully the University&rsquo;s Academic Appeals Policy and  Procedure documents which can be found on the University&rsquo;s webpages: <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/AcademicServices/CurrentStudents/AcademicAppeals.aspx">http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/AcademicServices/CurrentStudents/AcademicAppeals.aspx</a>. <br>
				You may also wish  to contact the Education Officer in the Students&rsquo; Association who will be able  to give you help and advice.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Complete all sections of the form. </li>
				<li>Be concise and limit your submission to the facts of the case. </li>
				<li>You may attach supplementary documentation to support your appeal. </li>
				<li>If your appeal case is not presented clearly and comprehensibly it may  be returned to you to revise before the appeals process can begin. </li>
				<li>As part of the appeal process, your case may be sent to a  representative of the relevant decision making body and to a member of the  Academic Appeals Committee so that it can be considered properly.  <strong></strong></li>
				<li>Experiences with which you are  dissatisfied but which do not fit the grounds listed in Section 2 below should  not be pursued under the academic appeals procedure. </li>
